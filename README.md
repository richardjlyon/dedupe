# dedupe

18 February 2023

A rust command line utility to deduplicate images in the Synology image file structure.

During consolidation of my photo libraries, I ended up with far more duplicate images than I can fix by hand. This utilit scans the images in the Synology image folder system, identifies duplicates, and deletes them.
